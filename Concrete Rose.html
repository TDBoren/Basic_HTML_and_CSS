	<p>Did you hear about the <span style="color:red">rose</span> that grew<br>
	from a crack in the concrete?<br>
	Proving nature’s law is wrong it<br>
	learned to walk with&#8209out having feet.<br>
	<br>
	Funny it seems, but by keeping it’s dreams,<br>
	it learned to breathe fresh air.<br>
	<br>
	Long live the <span style="color:red">rose</span> that grew from concrete<br>
	when no one else ever cared.<br>
